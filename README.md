# Julian Bendtsen - Portfolio

This project is a draft for my personal portfolio. It's a static website built with HTML and CSS.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- `about.html`: Contains information about me.
- `contact.html`: A page where visitors can send me a message.
- `css/style.css`: The main stylesheet for the project.
- `index.html`: The homepage of the portfolio.
- `portfolio.html`: Showcases my work and projects.

## Pages

### Home

The homepage, `index.html`, is the first page visitors see. It includes a brief introduction and links to other sections of the portfolio.

### About Me

The `about.html` page contains detailed information about me, my skills, and my background.

### Portfolio

The `portfolio.html` page showcases my work. It includes a variety of projects that demonstrate my skills and experience.

### Contact

The `contact.html` page includes a form that visitors can use to send me a message.

## Styles

The `css/style.css` file contains the styles for the project. It uses the Montserrat and Nunito Sans fonts from Google Fonts.

## Images

The `img/` directory contains all the images used in the project.

## Future Improvements

- Add more projects to the portfolio page.
- Improve the contact form to include form validation.
- Make the website responsive for better mobile viewing.
